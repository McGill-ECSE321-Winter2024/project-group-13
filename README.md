### **Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to design and develop a web application for a local sports center. The sports center has approached us to create a comprehensive solution that facilitates the management of various classes, scheduling, and customer interactions.

### Key Features:

- **Class Management:** The application allows the owner and instructors to manage different types of classes, such as cardio, stretching, and strength training.
- **Scheduling:** Owners and instructors can organize and update the schedule of the sports center, ensuring efficient allocation of resources.
- **Instructor Empowerment:** Instructors can propose new sessions, manage existing classes, and create new class types (subject to owner approval).
- **Owner Dashboard:** The owner has administrative privileges to edit information related to the sports center, manage instructors, approve new classes, and adjust schedules.
- **Customer Interaction:** Customers can view available classes, register for sessions, and manage their registrations through their personal accounts.
- **Accessibility:** All functionalities are accessible via a user-friendly web frontend.

### **Scope of the Project**

The scope of our project encompasses implementing the functionalities described above. We aim to deliver a robust, user-friendly web application that fulfills the requirements outlined by the sports center. While external integrations are not required, our focus is on designing a multi-tier software solution that efficiently caters to the needs of stakeholders.

Thank you for your interest in our project. We are excited to embark on this journey and deliver a successful solution. Stay tuned for updates on our progress!
